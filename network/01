# A network interface is the point of interconnection between a computer and a private or public network.
# A network interface is generally a network interface card (NIC), but does not have to have a physical form.
# Instead, the network interface can be implemented in software. For example, the loopback interface (127.0.0.1 for IPv4 and ::1 for IPv6)
# is not a physical device but a piece of software simulating a network interface.
