# Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics:
# a) Identify broadcast address
# b) Identify all IP adresses which are part of the same subnet


# Ethernet is Local Area Network (LAN) technology.
# It is a system with protocol to connect multiple systems on the LAN network connection.
# Ethernet offers connectionless communication.


# a)
ifconfig en0 | grep broadcast | cut -d' ' -f6

arp -ai en0 | awk '{print $2}'

# what is 127.0 0.1 even?
# 0.1, the IP address of the local computer. This IP address allows the machine to connect to and communicate with itself.
# Therefore, localhost (127.0. 0.1) is used to establish an IP connection to the same device used by the end-user.

# A broadcast address is a network address used to transmit to all devices connected to a multiple-access communications network.
