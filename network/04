# A network gateway is a device that connects two networks together. In the context of Linux, a gateway is often used to connect a local network to the Internet.
# A gateway can be a hardware device, such as a router, or it can be a software program, such as a proxy server.
# By using a gateway, you can allow computers on your local network to access resources on the Internet.
